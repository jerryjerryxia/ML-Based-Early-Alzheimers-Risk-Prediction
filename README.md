# BAX-452 | ML-Based Early Alzheimer's Risk Prediction

### Bullet Points:
- Applied Python (`sklearn`, `skopt`), constructed Tree-based classifier (both Random Forest and Boosting) to predict early Alzheimer's risk on patient bio features, achieved 99% Precision through Bayes search cross validation fine-tuning
- Applied Python (`sklearn`), presented insightful precision-recall, confusion matrices, and ROC-AUC score
