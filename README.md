# ML-Based Early Alzheimer's Risk Prediction

### Main Objectives and Findings:
- To help clinicians identify early Alzheimer's disease with easily accessible biographical information and medical data that can be obtained at a lot cost. 
- Applied Python (`sklearn`, `skopt`), constructed Tree-based classifier (both Random Forest and Boosting) to predict early Alzheimer's risk on patient bio features, achieved 99% Precision through Bayes search cross validation fine-tuning.
